I'm a data analyst. I like mathematical models, and I am exploring Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, and other similar fields. On June 2023, I graduated from CUNY John Jay with a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Data Science and minored in Computer Science. I worked for CodePath as a tech fellow, Citigroup as a summer analyst, Commit to Green as a full stack intern, and Teladoc Health as a mobile intern. Fun fact about me is that I love ramen.
