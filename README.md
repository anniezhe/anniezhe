I'm a data analyst. I like mathematical models, and I am exploring Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, and other similar fields. I graduated from CUNY John Jay with a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Data Science and minored in Computer Science. My goal is to sharpen my skills in Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and SQL. Fun fact about me is that I love ramen.
