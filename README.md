I am a data analyst who is exploring not just data analytics, but also data science, AI, machine learning, and other similar fields. I graduated from CUNY John Jay with a bachelorâ€™s degree in applied math with a concentration in data science and a minor in computer science. Iâ€™m learning Python, machine learning, and SQL. My goal is to eventually pursue a career in AI.
