I'm in my final undergraduate year studying Applied Mathematics with Data Science concentration and minoring in Computer Science at CUNY John Jay. I'm also a software developer with experience in creating and deploying web applications. Currently, I work for CodePath as a tech fellow. Prior to working at CodePath, I worked for Citigroup as a summer analyst, Commit to Green as a full stack intern, and Teladoc Health as a mobile intern. Fun fact about me is that I love ramen.
